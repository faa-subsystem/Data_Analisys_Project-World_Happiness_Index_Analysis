# World_Happiness_Index_Analysis
In this project we will explore correlations between different factors that influense the index of happoness in different countries. Data used in this analisys was obtained from the Gallup World Poll and was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happines. In this analysis, we compare the relationship between some factors that influence the happiness index of the inhabitants of various countries between 2015 and 2017. The objective is to analyze how the factors are related to each other.
